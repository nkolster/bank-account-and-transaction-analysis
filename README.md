# Bank-account and transaction analysis

This is a project where we analyze bank account transactions and categorize them, in the second part we look at one persons bank-account and see if we 
can predict the account balance into the future.

The documentation and analysis is in the pdf or [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZvCevt341jhC0kiWbZsByQAybiIXOE0bQn-FXn64b0/pub)

The code used in the analysis can also be found in the R file.
